1. first, to creditors to the extent otherwise permitted by applicable law in satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations of the Company, including expenses of the liquidation (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment), other than liabilities for which reasonable provision for payment has been made and liabilities, if any, for Distributions to Members;


2. next, to the establishment of those reserves for contingent liabilities of the Company as are deemed necessary by the Liquidating Trustee (other than liabilities for which reasonable provision for payment has been made and liabilities, if any, for Distribution to Members and former Members under the Act);


3. next, to Members and former Members in satisfaction of any liabilities for Distributions under the Act, if any;


4. next, to the Members, on a pro rata basis in the order of priority set forth in Article VII.
**Distributions in Kind** Any non-cash asset distributed to one or more Members will first be valued by the Manager at its Fair Market Value to determine the Net Income, Loss and special allocations that would have resulted if that asset had been sold for that value, which amounts will be allocated pursuant to Article VI, and the Members' Capital Accounts will be adjusted to reflect those allocations. The amount distributed and charged to the Capital Account of each Member receiving an interest in the distributed asset will be the Fair Market Value of that interest as determined in good faith by the Manager (net of any liability secured by the asset that the Member assumes or takes subject to).  

**No Liability** Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon a liquidation, if any Member has a negative Capital Account balance (after giving effect to all contributions, Distributions, allocations and other Capital Account adjustments for all Fiscal Years, including the Year in which that liquidation occurs), neither that Member nor any Manager will have any obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Company, and the negative balance of that Member's Capital Account will not be considered a debt owed by that Member or any Manager to the Company or to any other Person for any purpose; _provided, however_, that nothing in this Section will relieve any Member from any liability under any promissory note or other affirmative commitment that Member has made to contribute capital to the Company.

**Limitations on Payments Made in Dissolution** Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, each Member will be entitled to look only to the assets of the Company for Distributions (including Distributions in liquidation) and the Parties will have no personal liability for any Distributions.

**Certificate of Cancellation** Upon completion of the winding up of the Company's affairs, the Manager will file a Certificate of Cancellation, as applicable.

## Article XI

#### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; STANDARD OF CARE; INDEMNIFICATION

**Limitation of Liability** Unless explicitly agreed upon, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, will be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, and will not be those of the Members, or the Covered Persons.

**Standard of Care** Neither the Members nor the Covered Persons will have any personal liability whatsoever to the Company, any Member, or their Affiliates on account of that Person's role within the Company,  or by reason of that Person's acts or omissions in connection with the conduct of the business of the Company so long as that Person acts in good faith for a purpose which the Person reasonably believes to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding the preceding, nothing contained in this Agreement will protect that Person against any liability to which that Person would otherwise be subject by reason of (a) any act or omission of that Person that involves gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud, or willful and material breach of a material provision of the Operating Agreement or management agreement or (b) any transaction from which that Person or its Affiliate derives any improper personal benefit.  

**Indemnification** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Covered Persons will be entitled, out of the Company assets, to be indemnified against and held harmless from any and all liabilities, judgments, obligations, losses, damages, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings (whether under the Securities Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or otherwise, civil or criminal, pending or threatened, before any court or administrative or legislative body, and as the same are accrued, in which an Indemnitee may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with which he, she or it may be or may have been threatened, while in office or thereafter (a "**_Proceeding_**")) and reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements (including legal and accounting fees and expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever (collectively, "**_Covered Losses_**") that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted at any time against an Indemnitee (whether or not indemnified against by other parties) in any way related to or arising out of this Agreement, the administration of the Company, or the action or inaction of an Indemnitee (including actions or inactions pursuant to Article X on the Company's dissolution or termination) or under contracts with the Company, except that the Covered Persons will not be entitled to indemnity for Covered Losses with respect to any matter as to which an Indemnitee has been finally adjudicated in any action, suit, or other proceeding, or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, to have committed an act or omission involving his, her or its own  gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud, or reckless disregard of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. The indemnities contained in this Article XI will survive the termination of this Agreement.

**Severability** If any provision of this Article is determined to be unenforceable in whole or in part, that provision will nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permissible, it being the intent of this Article to provide indemnification to all Persons eligible under this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

**Insurance** The Manager may cause the Company to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Covered Person who is or was an agent of the Company against any liability asserted against that Covered Person capacity as an agent.

2. Alter the interest of any Member in income, gains and losses or amend any portion of Article IV without the Consent of each Member adversely affected by that amendment; provided, however, that the admission of additional Members in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will not constitute an alteration or amendment;

**Ministerial and Administrative Amendments** Notwithstanding the limitations above, ministerial or administrative amendments as may in the discretion of the Manager, be necessary or appropriate and those amendments as may be required by law may be made from time to time without the Consent of any of the Members; provided, however, that no amendment will be adopted pursuant to this Section unless that amendment would not alter, or result in the alteration of, the limited liability of the Members or the status of the Company as a "partnership" for federal income tax purposes.

 **Amendment Recordation** Upon the adoption of any amendment to this Agreement, the amendment will be executed by the Manager and, if required, will be recorded in the proper records of each jurisdiction in which recordation is necessary for the Company to conduct business.

### **SCHEDULE A**

#### **DISCLAIMERS**

Each Series, its members and managers hereby agree as follows:



*   The use of a “Series” or similar LLC is a recent legal advent and is subject to various legal uncertainties regarding its validity and use cases, including, without limitation, uncertainties relating to:
    *   the non-recognition of such type of legal entity and structure by other U.S. States, such as California, New York and Massachusetts;
    *   the novelty and lack of established precedent regarding Series LLCs and any liability “spill-over” risks between the Series and the Company;
    *   the lack of regulatory clarity regarding the taxation of a Series LLC; and
    *   the lack of regulatory clarity regarding bankruptcy proceedings of a Series LLC under federal law;
*   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the Member and Manager of the Master LLC shall be entitled to dissolve the Company at any time, in the event where there is any risk or threatened risk of liability to the Master LLC, Otonomos or the Master LLC’s Manager in relation to the Master LLC’s or any Series’ affairs;
*   Each Series, its members and managers may be required by the Master LLC, at any time, to provide basic Know Your Customer (KYC) information, such as copy of national ID, name, proof of address, among others, in the event where: i) such Series desires to obtain a bank account; or ii) the Master LLC, Otonomos or the Manager are legally required to provide such information  by the Wyoming Secretary of State or any other governmental authority; and
*   THE CODE, SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SERIES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE COMPANY, ETHERIZE ENTITIES LLC, AND THE MANAGER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS MADE THAT THE CODE, SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY PRODUCTS OR RESULTS OF THE USE THEREOF, WILL MEET LICENSEE'S OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY SOFTWARE, SYSTEM OR OTHER SERVICES, OR BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE, OR ERROR FREE.
*   The Series, its members and managers shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, Etherize Entities LLC, and its related entities and the Manager (the "Indemnified Parties") against any claims, liabilities, legal fees, judgments, or other losses incurred by the Indemnified Parties that relate to the disclaimers set forth above or that may arise from i) a Series’ non-compliance with the provisions of the Agreement; ii) any business or action undertaken of the Series, its members or managers; iii) the use of a distributed ledger.
